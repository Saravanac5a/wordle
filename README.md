# Wordle
A simple implementation of the famous game - [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) in Python

There was a time till recently when everyone once hooked onto this game called Wordle where a player has 6 attmpts within which they need to guess the word of the day. The clues are, for every letter of each attempt, we give the following information

1. Green: if it is in the correct position
2. Normal text: if the letter is present in the word of the day but is not in the correct position
3. Red: if the letter is not in the word of the day

## Dependencies
You will need to install ```enchant```, ```random_word``` and ```colorama``` using the following commands, if you have not already

```pip install pyenchant
pip install random_word
pip install colorama```

Feel free to use this code and improvise it
